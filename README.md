# Cloud Haven, By Nageeks

Built using React.js as Front-end and Node.js/Express.js as Back-end.

To run project, open both api and client directories in separate terminals. Then type npm start in both terminals, and open up http://localhost:3000 to see the webpage.

client is the React.js, being run on http://localhost:3000
api is the Express.js, being run on http://localhost:3001

# Quick Start. 
## Create your api/config/keys_dev.js file

example:

module.exports = {\
    mongoURI: "mongoURI here",\
    key: 'None'\
}

## Install dependences and start (node_modules should be created in root, api, and config)
npm install-dev\
npm start
